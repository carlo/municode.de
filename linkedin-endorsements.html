  respected by partners, colleagues and his team members. Especially the way
  he optimized syndication standards and processes is outstanding – to
  underline this I can tell that his specifications have become standards for

  he consistently produced high quality solutions and managed team members
  successfully to do the same. He established strong relationships with
  numerous external feed partners (we have around 40 on EU news alone) as
  well as key stakeholders. Carlo was pivatol in enabling us to create
  competitive and valuable sites in our 5 key EU markets.</p>

  Carlo is a brilliant developer, very well organized and focused, has a keen

  always willing to share his expertise.<br>
  One example of his creative approach and attention to the detail:<br>
  Carlo has a won a prestigious award - Yahoo paranoid T-Shirt -<br>
  for spotting a vulnerability in a globally used internal system not<br>
  noticed by anyone in the company.<br>
  Carlo is a wonderful colleague - fun to be around, full of ideas and<br>

  <p class="description" dir="ltr" id="control_gen_57">Carlo is a great lead
  engineer who understands the way things work on the internet. He keeps
  himself up to date on the latest and greatest the web has to offer, and
  generously shares his knowledge with coworkers. He's able to communicate
  effectively with both technical and nontechnical groups, which served him
  well in his role as a mediator between internal Product teams and external
  partners.

  In the two years I worked with him, I saw him excel in his
  position as technical lead inside the market engineering group at Yahoo!,
  instating practices that improved the group's efficiency, and hacking
  together new bits of software to solve problems that external groups had
  written off. Moreover, he uses his deep understanding of PHP, Ruby, and
  Perl in creative ways; he's one of the very few engineers in the Munich
  office who participated in every single hack day we had, and he continually
  came up with interesting Hacks that I enjoyed seeing him present.

  I'd
  work with him again in a heartbeat.</p>

  is astronomical – Carlo always manages to find the time to explain the
  complexities of the Yahoo! back end in a way that even a tech Muppet like
  me can understand.<br>
  <br>
  I can always rely on him for help, support and a friendly shoulder. He is a
